POSITIVE TESTS

-probably set up 2 global vars; lists with the number that user can select from each select list (doubles, group)

-How to test the text results from Number of Courts button
	str_expected = "1 court for 2\'s"
	str_expected = "2 courts for 2\'s"
	element = self.driver.find_element_by_id("crt_results2")   #alt crt_results3; crt_results4
	assertTrue(str_expected in element.text)

-How to test the text results from extra players
	str_expected = "There will be 1 extra player to manually assign to teams"
	element = self.driver.find_element_by_id("crt_results2")   #alt crt_results3; crt_results4
	assertTrue(str_expected in element.text)

	#with current implementation, there is not a case where there is more than one extra player at any given time

NEGATIVE TESTS

-Verify that no results display for 0/0

-Verify that ... test fails for unexpected elements
	i.e. if you only expect court results for 2's, test should fail when checking for elements (3's or 4's)

	#I'm not really crazy about this check b/c if feels a bit more generic (I don't get specific logged info about what the exception was)

TEST SUITE

-Think one file could contain all the positive tests (or is it better to have about 20 tests in one file?)

-Think one file could contain all the negative tests
	this should not hold up remaining tests b/c of the expected failure annotations

-Think I need to log results into separate log files

QUESTIONS

-How to test the visual results (drawings) from Random teams button
	?maybe count the number of rectangles drawn?

-How to test the visual results (random teams) from Random teams button
	?maybe test the range of players (each player must fall within the expected range; there should be no repeat players?)
	?1 check range
	?2 check that each player only occurs once?

-How to test the Reset button
	*would like to avoid having to test it for all combinations of select lists (don't think this would be very practical or efficient)
	-test for about 4 cases (4 doubles, 0 group, click court results button, click reset)
	-verify that no text displays in the court result area (no court results, no extra players)

-Would like to create some way of running test suite
	kick off and have all tests run (can be serial)
	but should eventually figure out how to run test in parallel (for faster results)
