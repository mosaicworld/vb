Test case design revised per reading How to Break Software (James Whittaker)

Note that for the latest test cases (#1 - 31):
  It's only possible to automate the tests results for clicking the first button,
  Get Number of Courts.
  To test the 2nd button, Get Random Teams, it would be necessary to have visual validation and the player to team assignments would be random on each try.
