major branches occur

> /Users/carolchung/Documents/working/2013/phonegap/072513/vb17c19.html
	in the comments at top, kept most of the history of the app dev history
	also it's probably the most comprehensive listing of bugs (fixed and open)
	also it's probably the most comprehensive list of enhancements (mostly pending)

> /Users/carolchung/Documents/working/2013/phonegap/072513/vb27g2.html
	this version and maybe several preceding, were experiments in dynamics visuals
	wanted to iterate through a for loop for a dynamic # of rectangles symbolizing vball courts
	will probably do a workaround

> /Users/carolchung/Documents/working/2013/phonegap/072513/vb28.html
file:///Users/carolchung/Documents/working/2013/phonegap/072513/vb28b.html
	this is the latest branch
	know that I can draw rect's on the fly (on page load)
	know that I can print the final court assignments with randomized players dynamically
	X->just pre-draw about 6 empty rect's
	>update the page with the court/player assignments text on top of the rect's
		not sure if this possible using canvas 2d
		but in the latest source, the court player assignments are being printed to console (rather than user gui)
	>downside (initially there will be empty rect's; and even after player assign, there will be some empty rect's)
	>may want to test out whether kineticJS is more useful to what I want to accomplish

beta2 release candidate
vb30.html with js/vb_main.js
	desc: moved most custom js into ext file but kept the canvas portion for displaying the courts and displaying the assigned team results in a <script> within the <body>; conditionalized it within a custom function (called in resp to button click in the custom ext js file)

beta release candidate
index.html => vb29.html

>>last 081013, 1:30am, tried to upload latest index.html to personal website but internet connex went down
>>tested 081013, 1:17am
	1 on android phone, the input fields are too large; text wrapping to a 2nd line
	2 the canvas size is too wide; probably would like to assign canvas width/height dynamically according to the device if possible

---

visual design/usability analysis

>vb30.html (081013)
	(no order of priority)
	X-on android, the app logo doesn't show up strong enough (either heavier font or larger or darker or change out font)
		main.css > increased font size
		darkened font color
	0-big thing is the canvas size: would like to test whether it can be variable to the initial window dimensions?
		http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/gopherwoord-studios-resizing-html5-games/

	-nav bar: replace the lines icons (no links) but like to add a reset button; possibly link to a comments form or at least a bug tracking form?
	-form: not crazy about the line spacing (inconsistent) but think it has to do with the responsive design (where it breaks vs just line wraps)
	X-form: don't like the contrast background for the select list labels (prefer for it to just be black on white text (no background)
		fixed vb30b.html
		removed class="label" from <label>
	-buttons: somewhere should add a reset button (basically should refresh the page or clear everything/form and results)
	-general: not crazy about the left alignment (definitely take out the indent on the list <li> elements); but even from the beg of form, not left aligned with the app logo, not to crazy about that
	-team display: it is working as expected and design but feel like it is taking too much space and scrolling to display too little information
		>play around (sketching) with dif ways to display the info in a visually interesting way but a little bit more concisely (at least 3 courts per row)
		X-vb30c.html > changed the court (no fill, just diff color outline rect)
		0-would like to fix so that 3 courts display per row

---

functional review

>vb30c.html (081113)
	-maybe the court selections (whether 4's, 3's, or 2's) should be more recursive?
	-one form of logic could be
		switch between selecting 3's and 4's courts (recursively) until remaining count is less than

old header notes vb18.html

<!-- NOTES diff vb18.html from vb17c19.html

	1 moved internal styles out to css/main.css
	2 worked on assignTeams() => vb18.html
	  assigning to teams of 4 players
	3 assignTeams() => vb19.html
	  worked on assigning to teams of 3 players
	4 assignTeams() => vb20.html
	  worked on assigning to teams of 2 players

>>>080513 need to work on the Court instantiation; guess all the court visualization detail comes from
	  a) court number; b) court teams; c) court size (this comes from teams info)
	  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects

	1 added global var listTeams (track which teams added to which court)
	X-looks ok; tested a little in chrome

>>>080613
	2 check for loop logic in assignTeams()
	  have increments like i + 4, i + 3, i + 2; not sure if they would also cause infinite loops; except splicing the arrays make them constantly shrinking so I don't run in the the issue

	3 check that there is a minimum # of global vars (try to correct where possible using param's)

	also see remaining todo's from vb17c19.html

	2 main remaining issues
	  how to handle a nice visual display of results
	  /Users/carolchung/Documents/working/2013/phonegap/072513/canvas3.html
	    >>above is a good example of how I'd like to approach layout of the courts

	  http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/tutorials/html5-canvas-rectangles/
	  http://api.jquery.com/width/
	  http://api.jquery.com/height/

	3 issue where displayTeamResults appears to get called at the very beginning of the page display; want it to wait as event handler to button click for random teams
	   need to research examples for interactivity with canvas contexts
	   ex. http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/advanced/html5-clear-canvas/
	   most of my js logic is in header but I think the canvas logic needs to be in script within the body
	   so can I have a function from the header calling a function in the body?
	>>>(vb27g.html) => tried to move as much of the displayTeamResults function out into the body script but there is still a dependency between the global var, listCourts; I think I need to use javascript that can be fully located in the header b/c of dependencies on the other header functions

	>>>(vb27g2.html) => the only way I got the canvas object to draw is if the rectangle is drawn statically, it is drawn on window load, rather than as a response to button click

	>>>080613, 11:30pm - what if I tried to move all the header script down to the body?? would that resolve anything?
	   >>vb29.html, functionality works but the source just looks very messy
	   would I be able to draw multiple rectangles dynamically?
	   1 want to get input from user
	   2 want to perform calc on the input
	   3 based on results of calc, want to output a var # of rectangles in the gui

	   alt, if I can't figure it out w/ canvas 2d context, also checkout KineticJS
	   http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-rect-tutorial/
	   http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/kineticjs/html5-canvas-kineticjs-text-tutorial/
	   (even if I don't want to animate anything, it might be better b/c seems to support layers and I want to have some text over graphics)

>>>080913: vb30.html, vb_main.js
	-what if I moved all of the custom js functionality into an external js file; but kept only the displayTeam function in the html (to insert context in right place)

	3 todo
	  how to handle the assignment of odd #s of people (extra players)
	  how to avoid doing the calculation of teams/courts players 2x (right now doing it one time just to get extra players; then doing it another time in the assignment of players to teams and teams to courts)

	4 remaining tech issues
	  *not crazy about the randomization method

	5 tech issues
	  group players 20; get a 4s; one 3's; one 2's; 2 extras => better if calculates one 4's and two 3's (even players)
	  prefer if can get back different possible combo's of teams (dif combos of all 4's; mixed 4's/3's; mixed 4's/3's/2's)

	>>>
	Issues

	A When fixed doubles 0; group players 20 => expect a team of 4's and 2 teams of 3's but get one team 4's; one team 3's; one team 2's and 2 extra players

	B Issue vb22.html (fixed vb22d.html)
	assignCourts(); issue in the first for loop where it just keeps iterating forever
	keeps adding same 2 teams to additional courts to inifinity
	>resolved by changing the way the for loop counter was incremented (in the for statement kept j++ but within body of for loop manually incremented j += 1)

old header notes vb17c19.html

<!--
	Test cases:

	1. 4 doubles players (1 doubles court): works ok for total 9 players through total 25 players
	   but above 25 players, need to start looping through the if conditions otherwise will have 4 or more extra players
	   which could be another 2s court at least

	2. (vb12.html)
	   bug 4 doubles players: 28 players
	   get -4 for extra players
	   (similar issues for 29 and 30 players; 1 initial doubles court)
	X-fixed (vb12b.html)
	   only restested for bug situations but not regression for old working combos with 4 doubles players

	3. (vb12.html)
	   bug 8 doubles players: starting with 14 players
	   should be 2 teams doubles and 1 team 3's; but get 3 teams doubles and 1 team 3's
	   then get -4 for extra players
	X-fixed (vb12b.html)
		tested from 14 players and higher (2 teams doubles); the negative extra player count does not occur
		did not do regression testing for old working combos w/ 8 doubles players

	4. (vb12b.html)
		not sure if this is usability issue; this is correct according to the code logic
		players = 30; doubles players = 8
		get 4 doubles courts; one 4's court; one 3's court => seems weirdly tilted towards doubles

	5. (vb13.html)
		test for 12 doubles players (for players from 12 - 30)
	X-generally works as expected
	
	6. (vb13.html)
		test for 16 doubles players (players from 16 -30)
	X-generally works as expected
	
	7. (vb13c.html)
		also think I should fix how I'm dealing with odd number of players; not sure that I need to do the count at the very beginning; it could probably all be counted at the end if remaining group players >0 and <=3 ...
		removed old if condition for checking odd on initial NumPlayers value (it will get caught at the end w/ ExtraPlayer value anyhow)
	X-tested all the way through for 4 doubles players (9 - 30 players); but didn't test extensively for remaining doubles players counts (6, 8, 12)

	8.  add the feature to randomly assign players to teams
		http://javascript.about.com/library/blsort4.htm
	0-implemented but something about the random number generation seems buggy

	9. (vb14e.html local)
		able to move vars outside of the function (declare outside and initialize values within function)
		NumPlayers, NumDoublesPlayers, NumGroupPlayers, Num2Courts, Num3Courts, Num4Courts
	X-ok

	10. (vb16c.html local)
		issue
	    something wrong with randomizer where sometimes there is a blank item in the arrRandomPlayers, not sure why this happens? 
	X-fixed in the randomizeArray(array1) function but it could be better
		don't have the issue where the randomized list is empty now but don't think the list is really as random as I'd like (players are usually only 2 away from each other at most on a team)

	11. (vb16d.html local)
		mostly doing what's expected but need to resolve 10 to move forward
	X-currently tracking the number of extra players (1-3 extra players) OK
	0-need to figure out how to report the player numbers
	0-not sure if they should automatically be added to the smallest teams or mid sized teams

	12. (vb17.html local)
		changed the input logic
		first input, is number of fixed doubles players
		2nd input, is number of remaining players (assume group)
		negates need for old NumPlayers var (reduces one calculation)
	X-tested a little but not extensively

	13. (vb17b.html local)
		hide messages that are not relevant (ex when Num4Courts == 0, don't need info about count or random players assign)
	X-tested a little; not extensively

	14. (vb17c8.html)
		revised the grid sys via bootstrap 3
	X-tested a little in chrome; not extensively

>>080113

	15. (vb17c12.html)
		updated the nav, content, and footer div styling per
		http://examples.getbootstrap.com/sticky-footer-navbar/index.html
	X-tested a little in chrome

>>080213

	16. (vb17c13.html, vb17c15.html)
		need to fix the issue where doubles player id's are getting messed up
		currently adding the count for fixed doubles teams to random doubles teams (when click random players for group and there's a remainder of 4 players); this is messing up the final doubles (random team) player number
		>resolution
		default doubles players = 0; assume people are going to select their own doubles teams
		remove one randomization button; change value: Randomize Teams
		need the internal logic to do one of two flows
		>>1 if doubles players 0, then just randomize group players count
		>>2 if doubles players > 0, then need to perform randomization on 2 lists
			list 1: for doubles players
			list 2: for group players (should start the count at number of doubles players + 1; to have unique numbers across all doubles and group players)
		>just started to change the randomization functions to account for this; haven't worked yet on the court/team players assigned display

	17. (vb17c16.html)
		issue: 0 doubles players; 7 group players
		extra player: gives an unexpected number (2nd to last array element rather than last array element)
	X-fixed; issue with calling splice on same array 2 times

	18. (vb17c17.html)
		issue: in the group players array (non randomized, it looked like values generated by string concatenation rather than mathmatical addition; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)
	X-fixed

>>080313

	19. (vb17c18.html)
		issue: still have confusing situtation where sometimes the 2s players will get populated from 2 different arrays
		?which do I pull from first?
		?how do I combine elements of 2 arrays into one output?
		>current resolution 
		1 track known doubles players in a separate array
		2 randomize list of known doubles players
		3 track group players in another array
		4 randomize list of group players
		5 assign group players to teams: 4's, 3's, 2's
		6 add random known doubles players to the array for 2s teams
	X-fixed; tested a little in chrome

	20. (vb17c18.html)
		separated the display from the randomized player to team assignment
		added displayTeamResults() function
	X-fixed; tested a little chrome

	21. (vb17c19.html)
		addressed issue where the final randomized players (2s) array was getting populated wrong (after group 2s, blank values were added and before fixed 2s, one blank value was added)
		issue was with the count of 2s courts (same value was added multiple times b/c I was using only one var originally to count 2s courts across fixed and group players)
		created 3 vars: var Num2CourtsFixed, Num2CourtsGroup, TotNum2Courts
	X-fixed; tested a little chrome

	22. (vb17c14.html)
		tweaked the grid so that desktop; widest is 3 col wide
		tablet: widest is 2 col wide
		phone: widest is single col
		X-tested in chrome

>>080413

	23. (vb17c20.html)
		should update the display for 4s and 3s courts so they're using for loops (like the implementation currently for 2s court display)
		it's still a temp fix; need to do it later so it splits into appropriate teams; but at least want to know that all players are being divied up into teams (no orphans or weird values)

	24. rewrite js so that it is object oriented
		-court object
		-team object

	25. reduce use of global vars
		try to write functions so that parameters are passed rather than global vars used

	24. archive source into git (not sure where to put, on cchung vs mosaic_world github)

	24. (vb17c10.html)
		would like to clean up the way the teams are being displayed
		would like a visual representation of the court
		would like to write out the player numbers on either side of the court
		created visual prototype/comp but didn't implement code

	25. (vb17c.html local)
		try a different method of list randomization
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
		try getRandomArbitrary
		maybe 1/3 of time, try to move a number into the middle of the list (as opposed to currently only adding it to the beginning or end)

	26. (vb17c.html local)
		track separately, the number of fixed doubles players vs the number of random doubles players
		**need to decide, when you choose to randomize all teams, how do you designate beforehand which numbers will be the doubles players vs which numbers will be the group players?
			maybe you need to create a list of 1-4 for doubles; and list of 1-5 for group?

	27. decide where to place extra people

	28. *also need to figure out how to interate through lists to display who is on which team per court
		display results visually

	29. marketing
		branding (look and feel)
		colors
		fonts
		layout

	30. TODO
		
		-would like to enhance the logic so you can get other combinations; for ex. limit to one 4's court and make the rest 3's and 2's
			-also I would like to come up with all possible permutations
		-would like to have a better 
		-would like to automate the test
		*-make a nicer GUI (style with jquery mobile)
		-figure out styling (color, any graphics?, like a robotic referee figure?, mainly think about the font use the google web fonts as we did in startup class)
			-really simple logo (need to do 15-20 min brainstorm)
				-sun, ball, whistle
				-ref shirt?
				-robot whistle
				-sunglasses whistle
				-skim images of ref's (what do you automatically id w/ ref's or coaches)
			-but the look and feel comes mainly from font and colors

	Issue:
	The current logic works ok but it always favors creating a 4's court and I think most people would rather play on 3's teams if possible
	Would be better if the logic gave all possible combinations for the given number of people, rather than just one fixed configuration
		-it's possible to do this b/c I have original copies of the NumPlayers and NumDoublesPlayers values (from the user input), and NumGroupPlayers (doesn't change)

	Concept:

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation
	?maybe also combinations
